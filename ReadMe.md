## Project Description

This code automates various actions on the Automation Exercise website, including navigation, login, advertisement browsing, product selection, cart management, and checkout. It utilizes Selenium WebDriver and Chrome WebDriver to interact with the Automation Exercise website.

## Usage

To use this code:

1. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed, including Selenium WebDriver and Chrome WebDriver.

2. Compile and run the `AutomationExercise` class.

3. The code initializes the WebDriver, navigates to the Automation Exercise website, logs in, performs various actions, and completes the checkout process.

## Dependencies

This project relies on the following dependencies:

- **Selenium WebDriver**: A library that allows you to automate web browser actions.
- **WebDriverManager**: A library that manages the installation and setup of WebDriver binaries.
- **Chrome WebDriver**: The Chrome browser driver, which you can install using WebDriverManager.

To install the dependencies, you can use a build tool such as Maven or Gradle to manage them, or you can install them manually.

## Scenario

### Test Scenario

## Test Scenario: Automation Exercise Checkout Process

### Objective:
To verify that the Automation Exercise Selenium Test Automation script successfully automates the checkout process on the Automation Exercise website, including login, product selection, adding to cart, and completing the checkout.

### Preconditions:
- Ensure that the Selenium WebDriver and Chrome WebDriver are properly installed and configured.

### Test Steps:
1. **Launch the Automation Script:**
   - Execute the `AutomationExercise` class to start the automation script.

2. **Navigate to the Automation Exercise Website:**
   - Verify that the script successfully navigates to the Automation Exercise website (https://automationexercise.com/).

3. **Perform Login:**
   - Confirm that the script performs login with provided credentials.

4. **Browse Advertisements:**
   - Ensure that the script scrolls to and clicks on specific advertisements on the website.

5. **Add Product to Cart:**
   - Verify that the script adds a specific product to the shopping cart with a specified quantity.

6. **Complete Checkout:**
   - Confirm that the script navigates to the checkout page and completes the checkout process.

### Expected Results:
- The automation script should successfully execute each step of the checkout process without errors.
- The script should accurately interact with the Automation Exercise website, perform actions as expected, and complete the checkout process.

### Notes:
- Monitor the execution of the automation script to ensure that it proceeds smoothly without any interruptions.
- Review the console output and any log files generated by the script for debugging purposes.
